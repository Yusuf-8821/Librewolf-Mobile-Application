# Project Title

Librewolf-Mobile-Application

# Explain

The Librewolf mobile application will only support Android and Android-based operating systems, and the basic features available in mobile Firefox will also be available in Librewolf (such as the use of add-ons within the mobile browser).

However, the basic features of the Librewolf browser will remain unchanged.
